# Security Policies and Protocols

## Authentication
- The system uses **JWT (JSON Web Tokens)** for authentication.
- The token is generated at login and passed in the `Authorization` header for all subsequent API calls.
- The **auth.js** middleware in the `shared/middleware` folder verifies the token.

## Authorization
- The system supports **role-based access control (RBAC)**, with roles such as `admin` and `user`.
- Each service validates user roles and grants access to specific resources based on the user's role.

## Data Encryption
- All sensitive data, such as passwords, are encrypted using **bcrypt**.
- Data is encrypted using **HTTPS** during transit to protect data in motion.
- **AES** (Advanced Encryption Standard) is used for encrypting data at rest.

## API Security
- **Rate limiting** is implemented to prevent abuse of the API endpoints.
- All endpoints are validated for **SQL Injection** and **Cross-Site Scripting (XSS)** vulnerabilities.
- The API uses **API keys** to identify and validate requests from clients.

## Monitoring and Logging
- **Prometheus** is used for collecting metrics from all services.
- **Grafana** is set up to visualize these metrics and alert the admin if anomalies are detected.
